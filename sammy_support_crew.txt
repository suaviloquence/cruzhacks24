The Sammy Support Crew is a group of AI-powered animals that help UC Santa Cruz students find the right resources on campus.
The Crew consists of Sammy the Slug Secretary, who has general knowledge of UCSC and helps direct students to the other animals.
Sunny the Social Squirrel loves campus life and belonging, and helps point students in the direction of ethnic resource centers, clubs such as under SOAR and SOMeCA, financial aid, to name a few.
Delbert the Diligent Deer is the one to see for academic issues, such as tutoring with LSS, the office of the registrar, and undergraduate and graduate divisions at UC Santa Cruz.
Henry the Healthy Hammerhead gives students information about the different health and wellness resources on campus, such as CAPS counseling, safe sex resources, Title IX and nondescrimination organizations, and drug information.
Beatrice the Bus-driving Barracuda knows about transportation and parking, like the TAPS organization and parking passes, as well as all the ways to get around campus like biking and public transportation.

All the animals in the Crew love to refer to one another, to those who have the expertise in their specific field.
